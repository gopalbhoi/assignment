			Indian Mutton Biryani
		</div>
		<p>
			Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of India. It can be compared to mixing a curry, later combining it with semi-cooked rice separately. This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as Iraqi Kurdistan. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat (chicken, beef, goat, pork, lamb, prawn, or fish), and sometimes, in addition, eggs and/or potatoes in certain regional varieties. The word 'biryani' is derived from a Persian word, birian, which means 'fried before cooking'. It is a popular dish that has acquired a niche for itself in South Asian cuisine.

			Dal Gosht
		</div>
		<p>
			Dal Gosht or Daal Gosht - is one of the very popular Mutton Recipes in Pakistan and India. It is basically a mutton simmered with spices, mixture of toor dal and masoor dal, or just any either of them. Whereas, dalchaa is mutton simmered with spices and chana dal (split bengal gram dal) with slight different method. Be it a Dal Gosht recipe or a Dalchaa, this is very frequent menu from my kitchen. And not just myself, but my family is a huge – huge fan of this irresistible mutton delicacy.

			Egg curry
		</div>
		<p>
			This south indian style egg curry. Because it’s cold and dreary and I’m shivering in jackets and boots and only a hot bowl of curry can make me feel better. Coconutty, creamy, spicy and tangy with a big bowl of rice and parottas on the side.
			I know we’ve done egg curry before but that was my north indian version, and the south indian part of me was begging me to share this with you guys! Hello Kerala and some inspirational cooking. I don’t know how they manage to get everything right! I mean, up north I wouldn’t dream of having egg curry for breakfast! You too? But next time, buy some idiyappams, pour that curry on top and go crazy! It’s the most satisfying feeling in the world! I can’t even! Because egg curry in any form is awesome, but this south indian version just tops it all.
